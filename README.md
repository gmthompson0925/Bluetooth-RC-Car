# Bluetooth-RC-Car
A very cool senior project built with Arduino and a lot of elbow grease:) This project is an uprgraded edition to my other rc project, 
as this one is connected via a mobile application with all of its controls. Wish I had taken a video of this one, but I had forgot during all the trial and error,
and then it finally worked!
